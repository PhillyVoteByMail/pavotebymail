More than [550,000 Americans had their mail-in ballots rejected](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/22/904693468/more-than-550-000-primary-absentee-ballots-rejected-in-2020-far-outpacing-2016) in the 2020 primaries. Over half a million people who tried to voteÂ ended up having their voices silenced because there was a problem with their mail-in ballot.

**37,119** of those rejected mail-in ballots were from Pennsylvania.

The goal of this site is to teach people in Philadelphia how to vote by mail correctly to ensure that their vote is actually counted.
